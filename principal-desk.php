                          <p><em><b>“Education means that process by which character is formed, strength of mind is increased, and intellect is sharpened, as a result of which one can stand on one’s own feet”.</b></em><br>

                          <p>At <b>Star Public School</b>, we believe that every child is unique and has potential to excel. We encourage them to develop a positive attitude and independent learning habits. We also give emphasis to character building as we consider moral values as important as academic advancement.</p>

                          <p>School is the most important part of students’ life as it enables the transition from childhood to adulthood. Our endeavour is to offer you every opportunity for self-development so that you will build your skills as well as your confidence. Our aim is to help you emerge as a mature and responsible citizen with the sensibility and sense of sacrifice that make one a good human being.</p>

                  <p>The world today has advanced so remarkably that all the information is available at the fingertip which can mould the minds of the students. It is imperative that the same care and emphasis are to be given to the formation of the hearts. In order to achieve this goal, we have a bunch of efficient and diligent teachers who gives importance in moulding the hearts and minds of the students through continuous and parental guidance.</p>

                  <p>Hopefully we can provide time for our children to be children. The realities of the adult world will be there all too soon. As children grow and learn, they find joy and satisfaction in working closely with their families toward a common goal. Such is the case with the students at <b>Star Public School</b>. Commitment to the best for our children on the part of parents, students and staff is the key to our success with the children we teach. It is the hope of the staff that all parents will help us fulfil this commitment to excellence on behalf of ALL children at <b>Star Public School</b>.</p>

                  <p>School and home can work together to build skills and knowledge, reinforce values, and develop a strong sense of self-worth. We must invest our time and energies in our nation’s most valuable resource, our children. At <b>Star Public School</b>, I look forward to share my knowledge and experience with my colleagues and dear students to keep the school’s prestige flying high and placing the school’s name positively at the top of the list of the best educational institution in the state and country.</p>

                  <p>Wishing you all success.</p>
