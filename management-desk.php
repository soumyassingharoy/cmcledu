                      Students are potentially the backbone of any nation. The future, prosperity, and omnipotence of a nation depends on how much well-educated and well-trained are the children of that nation. A school is not only responsible for facilitating formal education to the children, but psychological stability as well. In the line of this, I must appreciate the school and the head of the institution that did not only raise the standard of education in this school, but also emphasized more on creative learning of the students by incorporating art, dance and music as the active discipline in the curriculum. What really elates me about the school is the kind of disciplined life students are inculcated by the teachers which they replicate everywhere they go.

                      <b>“The purpose of education is to replace an empty mind with an open one”.</b> <br><br>

                      I always believe that Nation can be driven on the route of progress and prosperity only when the minds of men and women are equally educated. With the passage of time, <b>Star Public School</b> has emerged as an exemplary institution of being a school with difference and social motive.<br><br>

                      There is no better way to pay back to the society than providing the most desired and important infrastructure in the form of modern education.<br><br>

                      Here at <b>Star Public School</b>, we tend to build a resourceful individual out of a naive human, rendering them the wisdom which will lead to broader perspective of life.
                      <b>Star Public School</b> proclaims a powerful vision for the future of young people and has a deep understanding of responsibility to help shape their lives.<br><br>

                      We aim to unearth every child’s talent and provide opportunities which will enable them to discover something excited and enthusiastic for them by which the learning and buoyancy are always at par with each other.<br><br>

                      The academics and extracurricular activities, add a remarkable educational experience in student’s life. We are confident that in the years to come we shall equip our students with not only the basic knowledge of their concerned discipline but also a deep insight into it, so that they can stand on their own and achieve perfection in the careers of their choice.<br><br>

                      It has been a sincere endeavour at <b>Star Public School</b> to prepare students for a life time by giving them the best in education, values and understanding. The environment here is congenial and nurturing. I would wish each of our students to acquire the analytical, evaluative, and creative skills and to apply such thinking toward becoming successful in future, not only in their professional life, but also in their personal life too. I congratulate the head of the institution as well, for materializing such a marked difference in the all-round development of the school and leading the entire team with profound efficiency.

                      I have been witnessing the school and its progress since its budding phase and I have seen the school fighting against all odds and ordeals to reach to the state of grandeur and recognition today. I have been a constant eye witness of the toil and painstaking efforts of the teachers to uplift the quality of the school, not only in terms of teaching, but in the overall development of the children. Along with education, priority has also been given to cultivateetiquette, moral values and humility in the students. The children are trained here to face the constantly changing world by building confidence and cognitive ability in them. Thus, the children are preparing themselves with a shieldof competence and fortitude to face the vast world of competition with success. I congratulate the head of the institution as well, for materializing such a marked difference in the all-round development of the school and leading the entire team with profound efficiency.

                      Each and every student has different forte. Some have the spark to show their forte to the world while others do not get proper platform or might be lack of confidence. The teacher’s role plays a significant part at that point of time when they have to encourage those students to project their inner and hidden ability to the world which might bring change to their lives as well as the lives of others. I could see many students participating in different activities and are performing grandiloquently in all aspects. I could foresee a very prosperous future of this school and I wish that in the coming days the school will carve its niche in various aspects and it will be recognized as the brand institution across North-Eastern zone  and will pose itself as an exemplary institution preaching discipline, morality, punctuality and all humanitarian values.
